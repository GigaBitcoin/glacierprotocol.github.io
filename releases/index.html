<b><u>Release notes</u></b><br>

<i>Note: The release notes below (along with the release notes in the <b>document-only</b> releases) are provided for convenient, non-security-critical reference only.  They are <em>not</em> secured with signed checksums, and therefore are <em>not</em> canonical.  The <em>canonical</em> release notes are in the document appendices within the <b>full</b> Glacier releases, linked above.
	
<p>

If you are referencing release notes as directed by Glacier protocol itself, you should refer to the canonical notes in the protocol document itself rather than the notes here. The appropriate steps are listed in the protocol.</i>

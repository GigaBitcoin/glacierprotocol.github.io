<b><u>Release notes</u></b><br>

<i>Note: The canonical release notes are in the document appendices within the <b>full</b> Glacier releases, linked above.  The notes listed here, along with the notes in the <b>document-only</b> releases, are not secured with signed checksums and are therefore <b>not</b> canonical.  The notes here are provided for convenient, non-security-critical reference only.  
	
<p>

If you are referencing release notes as directed by Glacier protocol itself, you should refer to the canonical notes in the protocol document itself rather than the notes here. The appropriate steps are listed in the protocol.</i>
